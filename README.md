### Hello Pythonistas! ðŸ‘‹

First of all, if you have not known me yet, please check it out my profile describe [here](https://github.com/andresalerno "My profile").


Along your professional solutions, even yourt studies, it is so important that you can share your ideas and portofolios.

I'm studying a very good course called [Introduction to Statistics in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python) that I strongly recommend it.

Throughtout this repo you'll check it out some basic concepts to advanced ones.

I hope you enjoy a lot!
